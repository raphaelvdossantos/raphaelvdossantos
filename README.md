# Hi there, I'm RaphaelðŸ‘‹

## A bit about me :teapot:
I'm a software developer with 3+ years of experience who loves to learn and understand new technologies and practices. I specialise in front-end development with React but I have also dipped my toes in several other stacks.

In this 'short' time have worked in several fields with clients and developers from all around the world bringing solutions to all sorts of challenges.  

:hospital: I helped Philips increase efficiency in customer service and usability by developing easy-to-use and efficient healthcare software for customers in Germany and Austria.  
:telephone: Working at Encora I helped companies from the Telecommunication field from England develop safe & personalizable software.  
:bank: Currently working for Sinqia delivering innovation in the banking sector by helping my clients, understanding their needs and challenges, and developing software that handles their performance demands and safety concerns.   


## Technologies and Tools :hammer_and_wrench:
During my experience, I had contact with many different technologies. Some I have learned and enhanced by studying them in my free time

## What am I doing nowadays? :building_construction:
I'm currently developing a discord bot and webpage application to support and facilitate tabletop rpg games
In my spare time, you can also find me studying some technologies such as RabbitMQ, GraphQL and topics, currently on Functional Programming. I plan to, at some time in the future, try to develop my own framework for blogging applications akin to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for Javascript.  

At work, I am the main front-end developer of an application that aims to abstract complex steps to setup grids with data sources.
Technologies in use are:
- React
- Typescript
- Redux
- Apollo GraphQL
- AMPs
- Ag Grid React
- MUI
